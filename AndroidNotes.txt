XML View

-View Model = Abstract view like horizontal or vertical
-View = things like text fields and buttons

Java

-In order for the system to match a button method to an onClick event the method must...
	-be public
	-have a void return value
	-have a "View" as the only parameter
-Intent
	-Intents are used to start an activity
	-activity is like a new screen
	-Constructor takes 2 parameters
		-Context
		-Class of the app component to which the system should deliver the Intent
	-Must import the Intent class (import android.content.Intent)
	-An Intent can carry data types as key-value pairs called "extras"
	-call startActivity()
		-System receives this call and starts an instance of the Avtivity specified by the Intent

-All subclasses must implement the onCreate() method
-onCreat() must define the activity layout with the setContentView() method
